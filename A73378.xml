         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let us make a compariſon betwixt the Iewiſh Church ſtanding at the foot of the Mount, and the Chriſtian Church which ſtandeth in the middle of the Mount, and we ſhal ſee a great difference betwixt them two.

                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.13.</note> they covered it with a purple cloath. When they
<pb facs="tcp:152131:5"/> carried the Arke, it was covered with three coverings, with a vaile, Badgers skins,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 4 6.</note> and a cloath wholly of blew. So the table of the Shewbread had three coverings, all was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſave onely the Laver, and <hi>Moſes</hi> face was covered to them with a vaile, when hee came from the Mount; the Prieſts bare the things which they might not ſee, To ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a concealing of a part of the myſteries of the Goſpell, afterwards to be revealed;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.26.</note> ſo the people ſaw but through a grate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1.</note> but now the Temple of God is opened in the heaven, and there is ſeene in his Temple the Arke of the Teſtament; they ſtood a farre off,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.19.</note> things which are hid and obſcure, are ſaid by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes to be far off,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14.</note> and things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are cleare and manifeſt, are ſaid to be neare at hand; thus we ſee how farre the Goſpell exceedeth the Law; but yet we are not to vilifie and count baſely of thoſe ceremonies, for the holy Ghoſt hath regiſtred the leaſt inſtrument and the baſeſt things in the Sanctuary, and <hi>David</hi> gave to <hi>Salomon</hi> a patterne of the table, Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, Lampes, fleſh-hookes and bowles, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11, 17. It may be ſaid perhaps that they had ſome uſe then,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cot.</hi> 5.10.</note> but old things are paſt away, and all things are become new, what uſe then can they have in the
<pb facs="tcp:152131:6"/> Church now; they have no uſe for ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now in the Church, or to fore-ſhadow things to come, ſeeing Chriſt the Body him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is come; yet they have many other good uſes, firſt, we ſhould delight to looke backe to ſee the antiquitie of them, for even as men delight to behold the cloathes and Armour of their predeceſſors which they wore long agoe; So ſhould we delight to ſee the cloathes in which Chriſt was wrapped in his infancy, and the Cradle in which Chriſt lay. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſhould teach us to be thankefull to God, that we have ſo cleare a light under the Goſpel, which they had not under the Law; it was a great benefit to learning, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Hieroglyphicks in <hi>Egypt</hi> were changed into letters, and the darke and myſticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Plato,</hi> were changed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> into a cleare and plaine forme of writing; farre greater is the benefit that the Church hath now, when the Lord hath changed theſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and ceremonies into the cleare light of the Goſpell. Thirdly, theſe doe let us ſee that God will performe the reſt of his promiſes as he hath fulfilled all theſe types already, and laſtly, they let us ſee the miſerable eſtate of the Iewes, who cleave ſtill to theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as yet. <hi>Hierom</hi> compareth the Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:152131:6"/> Chriſt came into the world, to theſe that eate the fleſh, and he compared Chriſtians under the Goſpell, to thoſe who eate the marrow, but he compareth the Iewes after they had rejected Chriſt to the dogges who gnaw the bones, cleaving onely to the killing letter, but not ſeeking to Ieſus Chriſt the quickning Spirit. And now Sir, I dedicate this part of my labours to you, that it may remaine a note of my thankefulneſſe for your favours to me. I know Sir, that ye will make better uſe of it, then moſt men in theſe dayes doe with ſuch Treatiſes, caſting them by, and rather reade any trifle, than that which conduceth to the informing of the ſoule to God-ward, yea preaching it ſelfe they are weary of, except perhaps ſome new mans odde elocution invite them for a fit, but by and by they looke after a new ſtraine, as it were for new faſhions of cloathes. But I know Sir your breeding craveth another thing of you, who was bred up under ſo wiſe and religious a mother, who for the educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her children, was another <hi>Monica,</hi> as your ſelfe and your vertuous ſiſter, Miſtris <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> are ſufficient proofes. I cannot paſſe by her name upon this occaſion, whoſe life and death was to mean inſtruction. Good cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:152131:7"/> have you to keepe that methode, as yee have begun it in your eldeſt ſonne, ſo to proſecute the ſame with your many hopefull children which GOD hath given you by your Noble match, which is one of the beſt borne Ladies of this Land, who dignifieth her birth by her Chriſtian, humble, and godly life. Sir, beleeve me that godlineſſe is more true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to you than your birth, although you be never ſo well deſcended, and to be more eſteemed, than the place which yee have about our Gracious King, and more than all morall vertues whatſoever, which are but <hi>ſplendida peccata,</hi> without piety; your Honour and worldly credite are but trifles compared to this, they cannot keepe a man alive in this world, nor doe him any good in the world to come,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Pag. 171, the Lord gave his people the morall Law and the ceremonies; and the Goſpell; when the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law was given, it derogated nothing from the morall Law, there was nothing abrogated or changed in the firſt Law, or ſubrogated in place of the morall Law, but when the Goſpel came in, the ceremonies were abrogated, <hi>et ſuperinducta eſt ſpes melior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 137, 35.</p>
                  <p>Some Lawes are naturall and ceremoniall, ſome are judiciall and ceremoniall, and ſome are meere cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall; naturall and ceremoniall, where the ground of the Law is naturall, and the ceremony annexed, the ceremony being taken away the naturall part may ſtand. Example, the father was bound to give his ſonne a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion, becauſe he was his ſtrength, and becauſe he was a type of Chriſt; take away the type, the morall part ſtandeth. So where the Law is Iudiciall and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall. Example, Cities of refuge were appointed to ſave the mankiller, and he was to abide there untill the death of the Highprieſt; take away this ceremony, and Cities of refuge may remaine. Thirdly, where the law is ceremoniall and Iudiciall, a Magiſtrate cannot make the ceremoniall part, a part of the Iudiciall; Example, this was a judiciall and ceremoniall Law, that the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor ſhould be hanged upon a tree, and that he ſhould be cut downe before the night, becauſe he defiled the land, a magiſtrate may cauſe hang a theefe now, but he cannot cauſe hang him as accurſed or not ſuffer him to hang all night, becauſe he defiled the Land.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond reaſon, why the Lord put <hi>Iob</hi> to theſe hard tryals was for the good of his Church; for even as the Phyſitians keepe the bodies of the condemned to make anatomies of them for the good of others, ſo the Lord kept <hi>Iob</hi> for this tryall, for the good of the Church, that they might remember the patience of <hi>Iob.</hi>

                  <p>The third ſtrife betwixt CHRIST and the Devill was about <hi>Ioſhua</hi> the Highprieſt; Satan accuſes <hi>Ioſhua</hi> for ſtanding before the LORD in ſoiled apparrell, but the Lord takes his defence, putteth Satan to rebuke,

                  <p>There are two periods ſet downe here, our birth, and our death, and not our life. It is the manner of the ſpirit of God in the Scriptures to ſet downe the two extremes, and to leave out the midſt, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.8. <hi>the Lord ſhall keepe thy going in, and going out,</hi> that is all
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:152131:145"/> thy wayes, ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.11.5. <hi>And all the firſt borne of the land of Egypt ſhall dye from the firſt borne of Pharaoh that fitteth upon the throne, unto the firſt borne of the Maidſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that ſitteth behind the Mill,</hi> here the reſt of the people are left out for ſhortneſſe, and the two extremes are expreſſed, ſo <hi>Num.</hi> 6.4. <hi>from the kernell to the huſke,</hi> here the wine which is the midſt is left out, ſo <hi>Iob.</hi> 24.20. <hi>The wombe ſhall forget him, and the wormes ſhall feede ſweetly upon him,</hi> here the birth and the grave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole life. So here are ſet downe our birth and our death our two graves, the grave out of which we come and the grave unto which we goe; <hi>Iob</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theſe two together, <hi>Naked came I out of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, and naked ſhall I returne thither, Iob.</hi> 1.21. he was not to returne backe to his Mothers wombe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but he was to returne backe to the grave againe the ſecond wombe, and Chriſt joyneth the belly and the grave, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So ſhall the ſome of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth,</hi> hence it is that the inferior parts of the earth are both called the Mothers wombe, and the grave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.15. <hi>My ſubſtance was curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the earth,</hi> that is in my Mothers wombe, and as no man hateth the belly that conceived and bred him; ſo no man ſhould hate the grave which is his ſecond mother.</p>
                  <p>He marketh the two extremes here the birth and the death, and paſſeth by our life, to teach us the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our life, the Scripture deſcribeth the ſhortneſſe of mans life ſundry wayes? Firſt, he calleth our dayes <hi>anni numeri,</hi> that is, which may bee eaſily numbered, <hi>Iob.</hi> 16.22. when a few yeeres are come (yeeres of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) than I ſhall go the way, whence I ſhal not returne, ſo <hi>dies numeri</hi> ſignifie a <hi>few</hi> dayes, <hi>Num.</hi> 19.20, ſo

                     <hi>homines numeri, a few men, Deut.</hi> 4.27.

Secondly, our life is called <hi>ſaeculum, Pſal.</hi> 17.14. Thirdly, our yeeres are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>three ſcore and tenne, and if by reaſon of ſtrength, they be foureſcore, yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow, for it is ſoone cut off, and we flye away;</hi> if a man out live threeſcore and ten, he payeth intereſt for thoſe yeeres, much ſorrow and griefe.</p>
                  <p>Then our yeeres are compared to <hi>the dayes of an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Iob.</hi> 7.1. which was a ſhort time, the yeres of an hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling were but three yeeres, and the Lord to ſhew the ſuddaine deſtruction that ſhould come upon <hi>Moah,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Within three yeeres, as the yeeres of an hirling, and the glory of Moab ſhall be contemned,</hi> that is, it ſhall ſhortly be contemned, ſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, his dayes are like the dayes of an hireling, that is, they are very ſhort. They are compared to monthes, <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.5. the number of his monthes are with thee. Then they are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to dayes, and to an artificiall day from the ſunneri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to the ſetting of the Sunne, <hi>they are like graſſe which groweth up, in the evening it is cut down and whitereth, Pſ.</hi> 90.6. and to a watch in the night, which was but three or foure houres, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. then they are compared to an houre, then to a moment, and laſt to nothing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5.</p>
                  <p>So our yeeres for the ſhortneſſe of them are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a poſt, <hi>Iob.</hi> 25. <hi>Now my dayes are ſwifter than a poſt, they flyaway &amp; ſee no good, they are paſſed away as the ſwift ſhips, as the Eagle that haſteneth to her pray,</hi> Marke the gradation here. Firſt, <hi>Iob</hi> compareth his dayes, <hi>to a poſt,</hi> a poſt goeth on in his journey very ſwiftly, when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:152131:146"/> one horſe wearieth he will take another, and ſo goeth on; but yet he muſt reſt ſometimes: Therefore hee goeth further and compareth them to the <hi>ſwifteſt ſhips,</hi> that are called ſhips of deſire, the ſhip will not weary day nor night, yet there may come a contrary winde and make her ſtay; therefore he goeth higher, and he compareth his dayes <hi>to the Eagle,</hi> which of all fowles is the ſwifteſt to catch pray, and nothing can ſtay her untill ſhe have obtained it. So mans dayes wearies not, nothing can ſtay them in their courſe, but they flye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and haſten to their end.</p>
                  <p>So mans life is compared <hi>to the weavers ſhitle, Iob.</hi> 7.6. this compariſon would be marked, for the ſhuttle carieth the threed within it, and the weaver toſſeth the ſhuttle too and fro untill the threed be ſpent, and then he cuteth it off. So time is the weaver that toſſeth the ſhuttle, and our dayes are as the threed within the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which peece and peece are ſpent, and then death cutteth them off. So they are compared to a ſmoke and to a dreame, or to a vapour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. or to the breath of ones mouth, and to this the Apoſtle hath reference, when he ſaith, what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.4,</p>
                  <p>Now that our death may be comfortable unto us; firſt, we muſt remember that we are mortall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In that day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death, Symachus</hi> tranſlateth it, <hi>Mortalis eris,</hi> the conſideration of mortalitie in <hi>Abraham,</hi> made him to ſay that he was <hi>but duſt and aſhes, Gen.</hi> 78.27. <hi>It is appointed unto men once to dye, but after this the judgement, Heb.</hi> 9.17. If men dyed not, they could not obtaine life eternall, for <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption,</hi> therefore we muſt either die, or <hi>be changed;</hi> And <hi>this corruptible muſt put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:152131:147"/> and this mortall muſt put on immortality,</hi> and then we need not to be afraid of death, <hi>for it ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. as the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Ecclus</hi> 14.12. <hi>Remember that death is not long in comming, and that the covenant of the Grave is not ſhewed unto thee;</hi> The Lord ſheweth unto us that we are all mortall, and that we muſt dye, but he ſheweth not in particular the time when we ſhall dye, and therefore we ſhould be ready at all times.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, remember the advertiſements of death, when thou art faint and weary, thoſe are Gentlemen Vſhers to death, when yee feele thoſe meſſengers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>the ſound of their Maſters feet is behind them,</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, acquaint thy ſelfe often with death, that it

                  <p>Laſtly, that our death may be comfortable unto us, let us remember that it doth not onely put an end to our miſeries in this life, but it is the entrance to glory and everlaſting happineſſe, where we ſhall ſee the Lord and his Angels, and abide with them eternally; <hi>Moſes</hi> is renowned unto the worlds end, becauſe hee ſaw the Lords backe parts onely; but we ſhall not onely ſee his backeparts, but we ſhall <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> even <hi>face to face,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> heard many things of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and yet the halfe was not told her, but when ſhee ſaw him face to face, then ſhee ſaid, <hi>Happy are thy men, happy are thy ſervants that ſtand conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:152131:148"/> before thee,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.8. So in this life wee heare many things of Chriſt the true <hi>Salomon</hi> and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but yet the halfe are not told us, <hi>for the eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. But at the day of our death when our ſoule ſhall be ſeparated from our bodies, then wee ſhall ſee theſe things, and ſhall ſay with the Queene of <hi>Sheba, happy are thy men, happy are thy ſervants that ſtand continually before thee;</hi> and <hi>bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, Revel.</hi> 14.13. If wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things ſeriouſly, wee ſhal be inforced to conclude with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> here, <hi>better is the day of death, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day that one is borne.</hi>

                  <p>There are a ſecond ſort of people that God hath placed here below, and they are men; and there is a greater difference amongſt this

There are other men who are ruled by reaſon, and politicke government, for their God hath taught them, he may be called <hi>their God</hi> in this reſpect,<note place="margin">Eſay 28.26.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> calleth him the <hi>husband-mans God,</hi> becauſe he teacheth him how to manure the ground, and ſo God commeth neerer to them; they are a people here, but yet they are not Gods people, and it is better to be a dorekeeper in the houſe of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.10.</note> than in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advancement amongſt ſuch.</p>
                  <p>There is a third ſort who liue in his Church, and this is the higheſt ſocietie in this life, and here we ſhall ſee policie, juſtice, frugalitie, and all vertues, becauſe Gods worſhip is here, and as the inferior faculties of the ſoule are

                  <p>My Honourable Lord, I haue made choiſe of your L<hi rend="sup">P</hi>: to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend this Treatiſe to your Patrocinie, becauſe yee know what it is to be amongſt Gods people; many great men if they get their portion in this life amongſt the people of this world,<note place="margin">Pſal. 17.</note> they care not to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſons in the ſocietie of Gods people, and they content themſelues with the portion of this world, and ſay, <hi>Benum est hic eſſe;</hi> but this is a freedome which is bought at a higher rate, it coſt the chiefe Captaine a great ſumme of money to be made a freeman in <hi>Rome;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 22 28.</note> but to be made a freeman in the Church of GOD, it coſt the price of Chriſts bloud. Great men deſire to be out of this firſt ſocietie, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb facs="tcp:152131:154"/> not to liue like beaſts; but if they come to the ſecond ſocietie, to liue like civill men, that doth content them; they giue GOD thankes (perhaps) for this, that they are men and not beaſts, and that they haue beene bred civilly, but few giue God thankes for this, that they liue under the Goſpell, where they may learne Chriſt, <hi>not many Noble are called.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> Sometimes they may tremble and feare,<note place="margin">Act. 24.25.</note> as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> did,<note place="margin">Act 26.28.</note> and put off their converſion to another time, and ſome of them are like <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who almoſt are perſwaded to be Chriſtians; but few like <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 13.7.</note> who was converted at <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, you haue had ſtill the practiſe of Religion in your houſe, and one of the beſt helpes to further you, your worthy and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Lady, whoſe name ſmelleth now like the wine of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> when ſhee is gone,<note place="margin">Hoſea 14.7.</note> and now ſhe enjoyeth the fruit of that, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Nobilitie, birth, or worldly honour profited nothing; and this I write unto your L<hi rend="sup">P</hi>: beſeeching you to goe on in that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe, that both by your place and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, you may draw others unto the truth.

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.8.</note> this is the Motto of this Iland, and the farther

                     <p>The ſecond ſort of Determination is <hi>Iuris humani,</hi> when men determinate, where there is no expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, as concerning circumſtances, time, places, perſons, and ſuch.

When a man offered a Beaſt vnto the Lord which he had vowed, he might not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; this was commanded onely for eſchewing of greater evill; for if it had beene lawfull to change once, a good in place of a bad one, then they would haue come quickly to this, to haue changed a bad for a good: So this Law permitted divorcement for the hardneſſe of the peoples hearts, and for the eſchewing of greater inconvenience, leaſt hard-hearted men ſhould haue killed their wiues.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The puniſhments of the Iudiciall Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable.</note> the puniſhments inflicted by humane lawes are alterable: ſo were the puniſhments in <hi>Moſes</hi> Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law; therefore the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſay of them, <hi>aſcendunt &amp; deſcendunt,</hi> which they vnderſtand, not of the greateſt and higheſt tranſgreſſions, but of the middle ſort of tranſgreſſions, which <hi>praecepta media,</hi> their middle Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts did forbid.

                     <p>The Scripture compareth the morall Law to a priſon, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. the Ceremoniall Law to a ſecond Ward, and theſe Iudiciall Lawes to a Iailor, to keepe the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in cloſe priſon that none of them breake out.</p>

                        <hi>Iacob</hi> when he made his latter will, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.22. he ſaith, <hi>I gaue to thee one part aboue thy brethren, which I conquered with my bow and with my ſword.

                     <p>A father hath ſuch authoritie over his ſonne, that he might ſell him untill he was <hi>ſui juris,</hi> that is, untill he was one and twentie yeares old.

A miracle in the third degree is this, when nature in time could doe ſuch a thing, but cannot doe it upon a ſuddaine.

When a lumpe of figges was layd to <hi>Hezekias</hi> boyle, the figges in time would haue matured this boyle, and broken it, but when the Lord doth it upon a ſuddaine, this is a miracle in the third degree. So for the ſhadow to goe backe when the Sunne goeth forward, this is naturall to it, but for the ſhadow to goe backe upon a ſuddaine, this was a miracle in the third degree, but when the Sunne and the ſhadow both went backe, this was a miracle in the firſt degree, <hi>&amp; quoad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum &amp; quoad ſubſtantiam.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:152131:556"/> knoweth the place thereof: for he looketh to the ends of the earth, and ſeeth under the whole heaven. The wiſedome which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh of here, is Gods ſecret wiſedome in his workes of nature, which none of the world, although they were as ſharpe ſighted as the Eagle, can underſtand. Now if man be ſo ignorant in Gods woTkes of nature, much more is he in the workes of grace; and he may ſay as <hi>Agur</hi> ſayd, when he conſidered <hi>Jthiel</hi> and <hi>Vcal</hi> (Ieſus Chriſt the wiſedome of the Father) ſurely I am more brutiſh then any man,<note place="margin">Pro. 30.2.</note> and have not the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a man. <hi>David</hi> when he lookt upon the heavens,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.1.</note> the workes of Gods hands, he ſayd; The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſhoweth his handy worke: then he telleth how they declare his glory and what ſort of Preachers they be, The vniverſality of their preaching, their line is gone out through all the earth even, to the ends of the world; Then their diligence in preaching, both day and night; Laſtly, how plainely they preach, n all languages. Yet this their preaching is but an indiſtinct fort of preaching in reſpect of the preaching of the Goſpel. We may ſee ſome of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:152131:556"/> in the heavens which are his handy worke: but nothing of the hid treaſure and riches hid up in Ieſus Chriſt, can we learne by this preaching. But <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the preaching of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles, ſaith, their ſound went out into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world;<note place="margin">Rom. 10.18.</note> hee changeth their line into their ſound. There is a great difference betwixt theſe two ſorts of preaching, a naughty perſon winketh with his eyes, he ſpeaketh with his feete, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his fingers,<note place="margin">Pro. 6.13.</note> but hee ſpeaketh more diſtinctly with his tongue: So the Lord preacheth indiſtinctly (as it were) by his worke; but by the ſound of his Goſpel, hee preacheth clearely and plainely. Where ſhall we finde theſe treaſures of grace and hid wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? this treaſure is to bee found in his Law; therefore the Iewes call it <hi>deſiderium mundi,</hi> and it is more to be deſired, than Gold yea than moſt fine Gold.<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.10.</note> The Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſtretched out neckes, deſire to looke into this myſterie; even as the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims with ſtretched out neckes looked downe to the propitiatorie.<note place="margin">1 Pet 1.12.</note> If the Angels have ſuch a deſire to behold this wiſedome, much more ſhould man have a deſire to
<pb facs="tcp:152131:557"/> ſearch into theſe myſteries: for he tooke not upon him the nature of Angels,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> but he tooke on him the ſeede of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Happie is that man that findeth this wiſedome, and the man that getteth underſtanding, this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is onely to be found in the Law of the Lord.<note place="margin">Pro. 3.13.</note> I have indevoured (my Noble Lord) in this treatiſe to make ſome ſmall path for the younger ſort to this wiſedome; And I have abſtained from theſe queſtions which doe more hurt than good to the Church. <hi>Plutarch</hi> maketh mention of a number of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to one maid, but they fell to ſuch conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt themſelves, that they did teare her all in peeces: too many diſputations in effect doe rent the truth, <hi>&amp; nimium altercando amittitur veritas:</hi> the beſt way to come by the knowledge of the truth, is, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the Text it ſelfe, and to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in his owne language. Let it not ſeeme ſtrange to any, that I ſeeming a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould take this boldneſſe to offer theſe my labours to your Lordſhip. I cannot acknowledge ſuch ſtrangeneſſe: for wee have one Lord,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.13.</note> one faith, one baptiſme, one God and Father of us all; We live all under
<pb facs="tcp:152131:557"/> one gratious King,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.13.</note> and there is ſmall or no difference in our language:<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> we differ not as the <hi>Cananites</hi> and theſe of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> yee ſay <hi>ſibboleth</hi> and we ſay <hi>ſhibboleth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 26.73.</note> yee ſpeake the Dialect of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and we the Dialect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſmall or no difference. But the reaſon wherefore I made choiſe of your honour, is the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which I heare of you every where, your name ſmelleth as the wine of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> yee have put on righteouſneſſe as a garment, yee are eyes to the blind and feete to the lame:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.7.</note> the bleſſing of him that is ready to periſh commeth upon you,<note place="margin">Iob 29.14.</note> and you have cauſed the widowes heart to ſing for joy. There were many notable and excellent parts in <hi>Iob,</hi> he deſpiſed not the counſell of his man-ſervant or of his maid-ſervant, here was his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; yet when he ſate in judgement, what grace and majeſtie had he? they gave eare and kept ſilence at his counſell; the young men ſaw him and hid themſelves, and the aged aroſe and ſtood up before him; he was hoſpitable to the poore,<note place="margin">Iob. 30.1.</note> he did not eate his morſels alone, he was pitifull to the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and to the widdow, and he diſdained the wicked, that he would not ſet them with the dogges of his flocke: happy is that Land
<pb facs="tcp:152131:558"/> where there are ſuch judges. Another cauſe which moved me to grace this worke with your Lordſhips name, is the deſire I have, that others may reade it the more willingly for their owne profit, and even as a faire entrie leadeth the beholder to looke more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon every part of the building: ſo the beholder of this worke ſet out under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of your honours vertue, will the more earneſtly affect the peruſing of the ſame, in confidence that ſo much worth as is eminent in your Lordſhip would hinder any mans boldneſſe to preſent unto you a trifle. And for concluſion, when <hi>Jacob</hi> was to ſend his ſonne <hi>Benjamin</hi> into Aegypt,<note place="margin">Gen. 42.14.</note> he prayed that God Almighty would give him favour before the man: So my earneſt prayer to God is, that this treatiſe may firſt be acceptable to the Church of God, and then unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And ſo I have obtained that which I deſire. The grace of God be with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and make that the long continuance in the charge which his Majeſtie moſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath layd upon you, may produce long happineſſe to this Commonwealth.</p>

                  <head>A loving advertiſement to young Students in Divinity, who deſire to come to the knowledge of the holy Scriptures.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oving Brethren;</hi> There be three Schooles in which young Divines muſt bee exerciſed; the ſchoole of Arts and Sciences, the Schoole of grace, and the Schoole of your vocation. It is a great helpe and an introduction to Divinitie, to bee trained up in the firſt Schoole of Arts and Sciences: <hi>Moſes</hi> was learned in all the wiſedome of the <hi>Aegyptians, Daniel</hi> in the learning of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> was trained up in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie.<note place="margin">Act. 7.22.</note> A certaine Scholler amongſt the Jewes asked one of the <hi>R.</hi> His Maſter,<note place="margin">Dan. 1.4.</note> whether he might read any of the humane Writers or not?<note place="margin">Act. 17.34.</note> he gave him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere; you may reade them, providing you reade them neither day nor night: this was a fooliſh anſwere, for the Jewes hated all humane learning; therefore
<pb facs="tcp:152131:559"/> they ſay, <hi>maledictus qui aluerit Suem, aut didicerit Sapientiam Graecorum,</hi> they call all humane learning the wiſdome of the Greekes. But to ſhut up this Schoole, and to take away all humane learning from a Divine, were in effect to make him no Divine. The knowledge of all Arts and Sciences is neceſſarie for him, as of Geometrie, Arithmeticke, Geographie, the knowledge of Phyſicke, but above all the knowledge of the tongues is more neceſſary for him, becauſe they are <hi>Vehicula ſcientiarum.</hi> But here ye muſt not onely ſtudie that part of the tongues which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is mere Grammer, as to ſtand upon Letters, Accents, Pronounciation and ſuch, but ye muſt goe farther to that part which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the true meaning of the words, to interpret them out of one language into another, and to underſtand one Phraſe by another: neither ſhould ye ſtand here, but ye muſt goe further to that part which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to cenſure and diſcerne the true reading from the falſe as the <hi>Maſoreth</hi> did who excelled in this. Jn the warres there are three ſorts of ſignes to direct the Souldiers, <hi>muta, ſemivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calia &amp; vocalia: Muta,</hi> as the enſignes, <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocalia,</hi> as the trumpets: <hi>Vocalia</hi> as the words of the Captaine: So ſome ſignes are <hi>Muta,</hi> as Arts and Sciences; <hi>Semivocalia,</hi> as the knowledge of the tongues; and <hi>Vocalia,</hi> as the meaning of the holy
<pb facs="tcp:152131:559"/> Ghoſt ſpeaking in the Scriptures. The knowledge of theſe is moſt neceſsarie for you who intend to apply your minds to the ſtudie of Divinitie: for by them ye ſhall underſtand the Properties and Phraſes of the holy Ghoſt, the ancient cuſtomes of the people of God, and the ſweet alluſions in the third, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ye ſhall never bee able to underſtand. And if ye begin to learne theſe tongues when ye are young, to what great perfection may ye attaine unto before ye come to be teachers of others? <hi>Cicero</hi> maketh mention of <hi>Marcus Craſſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cicero De orators:</note> who walking one day upon the ſea ſhore, ſaw a boy who had found a boate there, but he having no helpes to further him to ſaile; firſt he got Oares, then a Maſt, raes, ſailes, and ropes, and then he ſet to the Sea: ſo from little beginnings, if ye be willing, ye may attaine to a great meaſure of knowledge, having ſuch helpes in this age, which your Fathers never knew,<note place="margin">Iud. 8:21</note> and the gleanings of <hi>Ephraim</hi> now, are better than the vintage of <hi>Abiezer</hi> was then; ye have now many learned and skilfull guides. The Jewes ſay, <hi>Qui diſcit a junioribus cui ſimilis eſt? Edenti uvas acerbas, &amp; bibenti è torcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari: at qui diſcit à Senioribus cui ſimilis? Edenti uvas maturas &amp; bibenti vinum vetus.</hi> Ye need not ſet your teeth on edge with ſowre Grapes, for now ye have ſtore of ripe Grapes gathered by your old Maſters. The ſluggard that keepeth his hand in
<pb facs="tcp:152131:560"/> his boſome, and ſaith, there is a Lyon in the way; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the Jewes are but fabulous,<note place="margin">Prov. 22.13.</note> and that it is but loſt time to read them: but remember that hee ſaid well, who ſaid, <hi>Malogranatum inveni, corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem abjeci, &amp; quod intus eſt comedi.</hi> Caſt away the unprofitable things and make choiſe of that which is profitable. Others ſay, they cannot attaine to ſuch perfection in theſe tongues as the Tranſlators have done who have Tranſlated, the Scriptures already: and therefore they will content themſelves with their travels; but how ſhall they know whether they have tranſlated well or not? They muſt give credit onely to the bearer, and if the Trench-man faile them, then they are gone. The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> was much more delighted to heare <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe ſpeake than heare of him by report,<note place="margin">1 King. 10.7.</note> for ſhe ſaid ſhe beleeved not that which was reported of him; and yet the halfe was not told her: ſo brethren, when ye heare an Interpreter ſpeake, ſcarce the halfe is told you: but when ye ſee it in the originall tongues, then ye will ſay; it was true which was ſpoken, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is in them exceedeth the report which wee heard. There is ſuch profunditie in the Scriptures, that all the wits of men can never ſound the depth of them;<note place="margin">1 King. 4.</note> it fareth with them as it did with the widdowes Oyle, it laſted as long as the Children brought veſſels: ſo there is much ſtore and plentie in them, that when
<pb facs="tcp:152131:560"/> they have filled the wits and underſtandings of the beſt, yet there is enough to bee gotten out of them, by thoſe who come after. And here J cannot let paſſe how much theſe honourable Patrons are to bee reſpected, who entertaine and cheriſh theſe profeſſors in the tongues, for without ſuch, knowledge would ſoone decay. <hi>David</hi> made a ſtatute in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they who taried by the ſtuffe ſhould part alike with thoſe who went to battell. The profeſſors of the tongues are they who keepe the ſtuffe, and they ſhould bee as well rewarded as they who goe to the field and fight in the miniſterie.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.24.</note> I have indevoured (brethren) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my meane meaſure of knowledge to make a little path unto you, to encourage you, and to let you ſee what profit you may have by this kind of ſtudie, and how it may ſerue you in your miniſterie, and if ye reap any benefit by it, be thankefull to the God of heaven the Father of lights from whom all good things deſcend, and then to my Noble Patron my <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> who doth incourage me much to go on in this kinde of ſtudie. And now when we have made ſome progreſſe in this firſt Schoole, and have attained to ſome meaſure of knowledge, ſee that your knowledge turne not like the waters of <hi>Iordan</hi> that run into the dead Sea, but let them be like thoſe waters which come from the Sea and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>turne to the Sea againe, let them returne to the praiſe of him who gave them.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 17.</note> Next when ye
<pb facs="tcp:152131:561"/> are in the Schoole of grace, that ye may underſtand the Spirituall meaning of the holy Scriptures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your ſelves with prayer. <hi>Elias</hi> was a man ſubject to the like paſſions as wee are,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.17.</note> yet he prayed, and the Heavens were opened and gaue raine: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ye be men, ſubject to the ſame paſsions to which others are ſubject; yet if yee pray earneſtly to the Lord, he will open the heavens, and ſend downe that Spirituall raine upon you, and fit you for the Schoole of your calling.<note place="margin">Ier. 2.8. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Things that reaſon is not able to do in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and matters of Faith.</note>Let us conſider firſt what is above the reach of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Divinity. Firſt, reaſon cannot bee a judge in matters Divine, for reaſon can never judge of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſupernaturall verity. Reaſon ſheweth this much to a man: when it ſeeth the antecedent and the conſequent, that this followeth rightly upon that: but reaſon never judgeth of the object of ſupernaturall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but Divinity enlighteneth the mind and maketh the ſpirituall man to judge of this. A Carpenter when he is working,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> doth ſee by his eye when he applieth the ſquare to the wood, whether it be ſtreight or not; but yet his eye (without the which he cannot ſee) is not the judge to try whether the tree be ſtreight or not, but onely the ſquare is the judge: So reaſon in man (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which he could not judge) is not the ſquare to try what is right or what is wrong, but the Word it ſelfe is onely the rule and ſquare; reaſon cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how faith juſtifieth a man, or whether works bee an effect of faith or not, but reaſon can conclude one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> of things granted, if faith be the cauſe and works the effect, then they muſt neceſſarily goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reaſon goeth no higher.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, no midſt taken from philoſophy can make up a Divine concluſion, neyther would it beget faith in a man. Example, God is not the efficient cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152131:575"/> of ſinne, the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> is a terme attributed to God: here if a Divine ſhould goe about to prove eyther by logicke or grounds of metaphyſicke, this concluſion were not a Divine concluſion, whereupon a mans faith might reſt, as if he ſhould reaſon this wayes, No effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe can produce a defect but an effect, God is an efficient cauſe, and ſinne is a defect, therefore God cannot produce ſinne; this were but an humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and could not beget faith.. So if he ſhould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the grounds of metaphyſicke this wayes, God is <hi>ens entium,</hi> and the properties of <hi>ens</hi> are <hi>vnum verum bonum,</hi> therefore God who is <hi>ens entium</hi> cannot produce ſinne, becauſe hee is goodneſſe it ſelfe; the concluſion were but an humane concluſion and could not beget faith: but if a Divine ſhould prove the ſame by a midſt taken out of the Scriptures, and ſhould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16. <hi>All that which is in the world, is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the concupiſcence of the fleſh, or the luſt of the eye, or the pride of life, not from the Father,</hi> this midſt will make up a Divine concluſion which will beget faith in a man, and then the Chriſtian man may ſay to the Philoſopher as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſaid unto the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> I beleeve not now for thy reaſon, but for the authority of God, which is the ground of my faith.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Philoſophy doth not inlighten the minde with ſpirituall knowledge, it inlightneth the minde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a generall knowledge whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. when he beleeveth, his reaſon at the firſt is mere paſſive; therefore this ſpeech of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> would be very warily taken,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Strom.</note>

                        <hi>vocat;</hi> as though philoſophy made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to ſaving faith: And this ſpeech of ſome Divines is harſhly ſpoken, <hi>lumen naturae accendit lumen gratiae,</hi> and <hi>Baſils</hi> compariſon muſt not be ſtretched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver farre, as Dyers before they bring on the moſt

                     <p>FIrſt, let us enquire how theſe firſt Principles which are called <hi>primo-prima,</hi> are made up in the hearts of man. Secondly, how theſe <hi>ſecundo-prima principia</hi> are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152131:585"/> deduced out of theſe. And thirdly, how theſe <hi>principia</hi> make up this which wee call <hi>Conſcience:</hi> and laſtly, we ſhall ſhew that man by this naturall knowledge ingraft in his heart, cannot come to the true and ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
                     <p>Theſe firſt Principles are made up after this manner: The Lord hath put two faculties into the Soule, one which we call ſpeculative in the underſtanding, and another which we call a practik facultie in the will, to proſecute theſe things which the underſtanding ſheweth to her. God hath placed firſt the ſpeculative in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that it might follow that eternall reaſon that is in Gods Law; for as it is the perfection of Art to imitate nature, ſo it is the perfection of nature to imitate this eternall reaſon, which is Gods Law; Then he hath placed the will into the ſoule of man to proſecute thoſe things, which the underſtanding the ſpeculative facultie ſheweth unto it.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome <hi>primo-prima principia,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>primo-prima principia</hi> are not naturally knowne <hi>quoad actum perfectum,</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, this breſtplate ſerved not for a triall of his doctrine, but onely for foretelling of the doubtfull events of things; for their doctrine was to be tryed by the law and by the teſtimony, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The Highprieſts might erre.</note> if <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> ſignified verity and judgement, then it ſhould follow, that none of the Highprieſts could erre: but wee know that <hi>Vrijah</hi> the Highprieſt in the time of <hi>Achaz,</hi> brought the paterne of the Altar of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and placed it in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.6.

                        <p>The Moderne Papiſts preferre it not ſimply to the Hebrew and Greeke, as <hi>Gretſerus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sufficit aequatio, non pralatio:</hi> But they ſay, that they will not have their tranſlation examined and tryed by the Hebrew and Greeke; for how know we (ſay they) that theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies which we have now, agree with the firſt originall Copie? we have the judgement of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this tranſlation, but not concerning the Hebrew and Greeke. But if it bee in the Churches power to make a tranſlation or to authorize it, why will they not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152131:646"/> authorize the Hebrew and Greeke rather than the Vulgar Latine tranſlation?</p>
                        <p>And if they inact the Vulgar Latine to be Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and the onely rule to decide controverſies, what ſhall become of all the Churches in the Eaſt that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the Latine; ſhall they under the paine of a curſe receive this tranſlation?</p>
                        <p>When the Vulgar tranſlation was concluded in the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> onely to be the Authenticke tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation in their Diſputations, Sermons, and Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Some oppoſed againſt this, and ſaid, that it was a hard thing for the Church, to judge that onely to bee Authenticke, which one man had done. And <hi>Aloyſius Caetenaeas</hi> ſayd, that no man could know what a Verſion meant, but by the Originall; and he alledged for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>Cajetans</hi> authority in the Councill, who being Legate for the Pope in <hi>Germanie, Anno</hi> 1523. was wont to ſay, that the onely remedy to refell Heretickes, was to underſtand the literall ſenſe out of the originall tongues, and he ſayd now, that the Cardinall would ſpend the reſt of his dayes in ſtudying of the tongues, that hee might bee the more fit to convince the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes; which he did, and he gave himſelfe to this ſtudie eleven yeares before he dyed.</p>
                        <p>Againe there was much contention among them concerning the meaning of this Canon made in the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> whether this tranſlation was the judge in matters of faith or manners onely? or was it ſo ſtrictly to be taken that it failed not one jote, and that <hi>Mathematice</hi> it was ſo perfect and not <hi>Moraliter</hi> onely? <hi>Andreas vega</hi> who was preſent at the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> holden under Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, ſaith; when the Tridentine Fathers call the vulgar Latine tranſlation, the Authenticke tranſlation, they meane no other thing but this, that it was not corrupted with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152131:647"/> errours, and that it might bee ſafely read and uſed to a mans ſalvation; and he concludeth, that the authority which the Councill gave to this tranſlation, is not to be taken <hi>infinitivè,</hi> but <hi>definitivè</hi> with certaine limitations. But if this was the meaning of the Councill, that the faithfull might ſafely read it, becauſe there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of errour; then what authority or prerogative had this verſion by the Councill, above that tranſlation of <hi>Pagnine</hi> for the Doctors of <hi>Lovan</hi> by the approbation of the Pope, put the tranſlation of <hi>Pagnine</hi> with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text. But the former Catholickes ſay, that hee who tranſlated the Hebrew into the Vulgar Latine, was not an Interpreter, but a Prophet: but how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it that others ſay now, that this Interpreter might erre, although not groſſely? that he might erre, not in <hi>ſide &amp; moralibus,</hi> but in leſſer matters? and ſo they will have the Councill to be underſtood; but they of old ſayd plainely, that in every thing this tranſlation was Authenticke.</p>

                        <p>The Syriack tranſlation was firſt tranſlated into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine by <hi>Guido Fabricius,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Tremellius. Genebrard</hi> and <hi>Serarius</hi> taking occaſion upon this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, charged <hi>Tremellius</hi> with great forgerie. Firſt, that he tooke away all the Titles from the Epiſtles; but this was no forgerie: for neyther the Superſcriptions nor the Subſcriptions are any part of the Canonicall Scripture, as may be ſeene before in the poſtſcripts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Syriacke tranſlation. Secondly, they charge him, that he tooke away the Calender, for the reading of the Goſpel upon holy dayes: but neyther the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Calender, nor the Syriacke Calender, are Divine Scripture; and that uſe, for which they ſay this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender ſerved, for reading of the Goſpel upon holy dayes; was onely uſed in the weſterne Romiſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but not in the Eaſterne Churches. Thirdly, they ſay that he committed <hi>Plagium</hi> in ſtealing his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Guido Fabricius,</hi> and ſetting it out under his owne name: but what diligence he uſed in tranſlation of the Syriack, he who wrote his life teſtifieth. And
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152131:648"/> will any man thinke that he who was a native Iew, borne and trained up in theſe tongues, was ſo ignorant, that he had no skill, but that which he did ſteall from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and <hi>Gretſerus</hi> addeth, that firſt he was a Iew, and then he became a Monke, thirdly, a Calvaniſt or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonite, and laſtly, that hee returned to his vomite againe, and dyed a Iew. But that yee may perceive what a Railer this was, who ſpared neyther the living nor the dead, I will ſet downe a memorable proofe of his death; he who wrote <hi>Apophthegmata morientium,</hi> (the notable ſayings which ſundry uttered at the laſt houre of their death,) relateth this of him. When they demanded of him what confeſſion hee would make of his faith? he ſayd, <hi>Vivat Chriſtus &amp; pereat Barabbas.</hi> Whereas the reſt of the Iewes cryed, <hi>Vivat Barabbas, &amp; pereat Chriſtus,</hi> this he ſayd to ſignifie that he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Iudaiſme, and tooke him onely to the merites of Chriſt.

A father hath a ſonne who is farre from him, he biddeth the Tailor ſhape a coate to him, and to take the meaſure by another child who is there preſent, but withall hee biddeth the Taylor make it larger; becauſe his child will waxe taller: So this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>David</hi> was firſt cut out (as it were) for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> his ſonne, but yet it had a larger extent: for it is applyed to Chriſt who is greater than <hi>Salomon:</hi> and as by a ſphere of wood wee take up the celeſtiall ſpheres: So by the promiſes made to <hi>David</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Salomon,</hi> we take up him who is greater than <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> and theſe two make but up one ſenſe.

                     <p>When a teſtimony is cited out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the new, the Spirit of God intendeth, that this is the proper meaning in both the places, and that they make not up two divers ſenſes.

                     <p>When the teſtimonies of the Old Teſtament are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the new, they are not cited by way of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, but becauſe they are the proper meaning of the places; if they were cited by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles onely by way of accommodation; then the Iewes might have taken exception, and ſayd, that theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies made nothing againſt them: becauſe it was not the meaning of the holy Ghoſt who indited theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſpeake againſt them. But Chriſt and his Apoſtles bring out theſe teſtimonies, as properly meant of them, and not by way of accommodation onely.</p>
                     <p>We muſt make a diſtinction betwixt theſe two,<note place="margin">Applicatio deſtinata Applicatio per accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modatione</note>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152131:662"/> they belonged, than Preachers have now, and knew particularly what Scriptures were directed to ſuch and ſuch men.

                     <p>Where there are two ſeverall teſtimonies found in the old Teſtament, and joyned together in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe two make but one literall ſenſe, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 62.11. <hi>Say to the daughter of Sion, behold thy Salvation cometh.</hi> So <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>O Daughter of Sion, O Daughter of Ieruſalem, behold thy King commeth riding upon an Aſſe, and upon an Aſſe Coalt: Matthew</hi> citing theſe places <hi>cap.</hi> 23. joyneth them both together, and ſheweth that both <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Zacharie</hi> meant of Chriſt comming in humilitie and not in glorie, and theſe two make up but one literall ſenſe.</p>
